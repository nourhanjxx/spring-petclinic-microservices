# Architectural Smells (Spring Petclinic Microservices Ground Truth)

| Smell | Primary Service / Module | Code File Path (if applicable) | Code Line(s) | Labeling justification in details |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Insufficient Modularization | Petclinic monolith application | `src/main/java/org/springframework/samples/petclinic/owner/OwnerController.java`; `src/main/java/org/springframework/samples/petclinic/owner/PetController.java`; `src/main/java/org/springframework/samples/petclinic/owner/VisitController.java`; `src/main/java/org/springframework/samples/petclinic/vet/VetController.java` | OwnerController:L73-L175; PetController:L99-L180; VisitController:L84-L101; VetController:L44-L75 | The single Spring Boot deployment owns owner self-service flows, pet lifecycle management, visit booking, and veterinary directory endpoints in the same module. OwnerController handles owner CRUD, PetController mutates pets under the same repository, VisitController coordinates visit creation by directly persisting owner aggregates, and VetController publishes vet listings, demonstrating multiple bounded contexts collapsed into one service instead of separate modules or services. |
| Unversioned API | Petclinic monolith application | `src/main/java/org/springframework/samples/petclinic/owner/OwnerController.java`; `src/main/java/org/springframework/samples/petclinic/owner/PetController.java`; `src/main/java/org/springframework/samples/petclinic/owner/VisitController.java`; `src/main/java/org/springframework/samples/petclinic/vet/VetController.java`; `src/main/java/org/springframework/samples/petclinic/system/CrashController.java`; `src/main/java/org/springframework/samples/petclinic/system/WelcomeController.java` | OwnerController:L73-L175; PetController:L99-L158; VisitController:L84-L101; VetController:L44-L75; CrashController:L31-L34; WelcomeController:L25-L27 | All HTTP handlers are mounted directly at root-level paths such as `/owners`, `/pets`, `/vets`, `/owners/{ownerId}/pets/{petId}/visits/new`, `/oups`, and `/`. No URI version segment or media-type negotiation is implemented, preventing the team from running v1 and v2 APIs concurrently and forcing breaking changes onto consumers. |
| Shared Persistency | Petclinic monolith application | `src/main/resources/application.properties`; `src/main/resources/application-mysql.properties`; `src/main/resources/application-postgres.properties` | application.properties:L1-L11; application-mysql.properties:L1-L7; application-postgres.properties:L1-L7 | All runtime profiles target the single `petclinic` schema, whether the app runs with the in-memory profile or the optional MySQL and Postgres configurations. This pushes owner, pet, visit, and vet data from every feature area into one physical database instead of isolating persistence per bounded context. |
| Broken Modularization | Petclinic owner domain | `src/main/java/org/springframework/samples/petclinic/owner/Owner.java`; `src/main/java/org/springframework/samples/petclinic/owner/Pet.java`; `src/main/java/org/springframework/samples/petclinic/owner/PetController.java`; `src/main/java/org/springframework/samples/petclinic/owner/VisitController.java` | Owner.java:L65-L175; Pet.java:L49-L84; PetController.java:L99-L180; VisitController.java:L62-L100 | Owner aggregates cascade persistence to pets and visits and expose helper methods like `addVisit`, while PetController and VisitController both operate inside the owner package and persist changes through the owner aggregate. Cross-cutting responsibilities for pet lifecycle and visit scheduling are hard-wired into the owner module rather than living in dedicated modules. |
| Hub-like Dependency | Petclinic owner repository | `src/main/java/org/springframework/samples/petclinic/owner/OwnerRepository.java`; `src/main/java/org/springframework/samples/petclinic/owner/OwnerController.java`; `src/main/java/org/springframework/samples/petclinic/owner/PetController.java`; `src/main/java/org/springframework/samples/petclinic/owner/VisitController.java` | OwnerRepository.java:L37-L61; OwnerController.java:L54-L158; PetController.java:L53-L180; VisitController.java:L44-L100 | OwnerRepository acts as a hub for every customer-facing flow: owner profile CRUD, pet registration and editing, and visit booking all call back into the same JPA repository instance. Controllers across multiple concerns depend on it, so changes to the owner persistence contract ripple through pet and visit endpoints as well. |
