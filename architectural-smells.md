# Architectural Smells (Spring Petclinic Microservices Ground Truth)

| Smell | Primary Service / Module | Code File Path (if applicable) | Code Line(s) | Labeling justification in details |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Insufficient Modularization | spring-petclinic-customers-service, spring-petclinic-visits-service, spring-petclinic-vets-service | `src/main/java/org/springframework/samples/petclinic/owner/OwnerController.java`; `src/main/java/org/springframework/samples/petclinic/owner/PetController.java`; `src/main/java/org/springframework/samples/petclinic/owner/VisitController.java`; `src/main/java/org/springframework/samples/petclinic/vet/VetController.java` | OwnerController:L73-L175; PetController:L99-L180; VisitController:L84-L101; VetController:L44-L75 | The single Spring Boot deployment owns owner self-service flows, pet lifecycle management, visit booking, and veterinary directory endpoints in the same module. OwnerController handles owner CRUD, PetController mutates pets under the same repository, VisitController coordinates visit creation by directly persisting owner aggregates, and VetController publishes vet listings, demonstrating multiple bounded contexts collapsed into one service instead of separate modules or services. |
| Unversioned API | spring-petclinic-customers-service, spring-petclinic-visits-service, spring-petclinic-vets-service, spring-petclinic-admin-server | `src/main/java/org/springframework/samples/petclinic/owner/OwnerController.java`; `src/main/java/org/springframework/samples/petclinic/owner/PetController.java`; `src/main/java/org/springframework/samples/petclinic/owner/VisitController.java`; `src/main/java/org/springframework/samples/petclinic/vet/VetController.java`; `src/main/java/org/springframework/samples/petclinic/system/CrashController.java`; `src/main/java/org/springframework/samples/petclinic/system/WelcomeController.java` | OwnerController:L73-L175; PetController:L99-L158; VisitController:L84-L101; VetController:L44-L75; CrashController:L31-L34; WelcomeController:L25-L27 | All HTTP handlers are mounted directly at root-level paths such as `/owners`, `/pets`, `/vets`, `/owners/{ownerId}/pets/{petId}/visits/new`, `/oups`, and `/`. No URI version segment or media-type negotiation is implemented, preventing the team from running v1 and v2 APIs concurrently and forcing breaking changes onto consumers. |
| Shared Persistency | spring-petclinic-customers-service, spring-petclinic-visits-service, spring-petclinic-vets-service | `src/main/resources/application.properties`; `src/main/resources/application-mysql.properties`; `src/main/resources/application-postgres.properties` | application.properties:L1-L24; application-mysql.properties:L1-L7; application-postgres.properties:L1-L7 | All runtime profiles target the single `petclinic` schema, whether the app runs with the in-memory profile or the optional MySQL and Postgres configurations. The only stateful slices—owners, pets, visits, and vets—save through this datasource, while supporting controllers like the welcome and crash handlers stay stateless, so the shared-database smell is limited to those three functional features. |
| Broken Modularization | spring-petclinic-customers-service | `src/main/java/org/springframework/samples/petclinic/owner/Owner.java`; `src/main/java/org/springframework/samples/petclinic/owner/Pet.java`; `src/main/java/org/springframework/samples/petclinic/owner/PetController.java`; `src/main/java/org/springframework/samples/petclinic/owner/VisitController.java` | Owner.java:L65-L175; Pet.java:L49-L84; PetController.java:L99-L180; VisitController:L62-L100 | Owner aggregates cascade persistence to pets and visits and expose helper methods like `addVisit`, while PetController and VisitController both operate inside the owner package and persist changes through the owner aggregate. Cross-cutting responsibilities for pet lifecycle and visit scheduling are hard-wired into the owner module rather than living in dedicated modules. |
| Hub-like Dependency | spring-petclinic-customers-service | `src/main/java/org/springframework/samples/petclinic/owner/OwnerRepository.java`; `src/main/java/org/springframework/samples/petclinic/owner/OwnerController.java`; `src/main/java/org/springframework/samples/petclinic/owner/PetController.java`; `src/main/java/org/springframework/samples/petclinic/owner/VisitController.java` | OwnerRepository.java:L37-L61; OwnerController:L54-L158; PetController:L53-L180; VisitController:L44-L100 | OwnerRepository acts as a hub for every customer-facing flow: owner profile CRUD, pet registration and editing, and visit booking all call back into the same JPA repository instance. Controllers across multiple concerns depend on it, so changes to the owner persistence contract ripple through pet and visit endpoints as well. |
| Unnecessary Abstraction | spring-petclinic-vets-service | `src/main/java/org/springframework/samples/petclinic/vet/Vets.java`; `src/main/java/org/springframework/samples/petclinic/vet/VetController.java` | Vets.java:L25-L41; VetController.java:L44-L75 | The vets HTTP endpoints must construct a dedicated `Vets` wrapper that simply holds a `List<Vet>` before returning repository results. Because the wrapper adds no behavior or isolation, controllers copy data into it for both HTML and JSON responses, creating a redundant abstraction over the raw collection. |
| Cyclic Dependency | spring-petclinic-customers-service, spring-petclinic-visits-service | `src/main/java/org/springframework/samples/petclinic/owner/VisitController.java`; `src/main/java/org/springframework/samples/petclinic/owner/Owner.java`; `src/main/java/org/springframework/samples/petclinic/owner/Pet.java` | VisitController.java:L62-L100; Owner.java:L160-L175; Pet.java:L57-L84 | The visit workflow loads an owner, attaches the visit through `Owner.addVisit`, and persists the entire owner aggregate so the new visit is stored. Because the owner aggregate itself depends on pet and visit collections to satisfy that call, visit lifecycle changes require touching owner-domain classes and the owning repository, forming a cycle between visit management and the customer module. |
| Greedy Service | spring-petclinic-customers-service | `src/main/java/org/springframework/samples/petclinic/owner/PetController.java` | PetController.java:L62-L180 | `PetController` itself drives owner lookups, pet-type catalog queries, duplicate-name enforcement, birth-date validation, and persistence of the full owner aggregate when pets change. Instead of delegating to narrower services, it scripts validation, repository access, and aggregate mutation in one class, concentrating several responsibilities in a single service layer component. |

The remaining infrastructure pieces—namely the welcome and crash controllers and the shared cache/web configuration—do not introduce additional architectural smells because they stay stateless, expose only root-level HTML endpoints, and avoid persistence or cross-service orchestration.
