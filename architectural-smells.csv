OwnerController handles owner CRUD, PetController mutates pets under the same repository, VisitController coordinates visit creation by directly persisting owner aggregates, and VetController publishes vet listings, demonstrating multiple bounded contexts collapsed into one service instead of separate modules or services."

No URI version segment or media-type negotiation is implemented, preventing the team from running v1 and v2 APIs concurrently and forcing breaking changes onto consumers."
